ðŸŽ¯ Project Introduction:<br />
AtliQ Motors is an automotive giant from the USA specializing in electric vehicles (EV). In the last 5 years, their market share rose to 25% in electric and hybrid vehicles segment in North America. As a part of their expansion plans, they wanted to launch their bestselling models in India where their market share is less than 2%. The chief of AtliQ Motors India wanted to do a detailed market study of existing EV/Hybrid market in India before proceeding further.
